          <h3>Bernard Kobos</h3>
          <p>I started coding during primary school being inspired by older brothers' home assignments. During years I developed bigger and smaller apps in various programming languages, both as professional and personal pet projects. Not being satisfied with innovativeness of the tasks, I started applying for fully remote positions at startup companies to work on cutting edge projects which could better utilize my skill set. Currently I'm working in a test-centered company that strongly believes in automated testing solutions. We provide infrastructure and work on making testing more accessible for every developer. I've been contributing to open source projects such as: WD.js, Selenium Builder and Appium.</p>
